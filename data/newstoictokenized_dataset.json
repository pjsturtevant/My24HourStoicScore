He did a great job and I am thrilled that he has found a calling. I need to be more enthusiastic about this floor for Penny because she sacrificed a lot saving for it. I was not practicing justice today. When I embark on a course or spend money for something I crave acknowledgment, which I am working to moderate. I was reserved in my enthusiasm for the new floor. I could tell that this saddened her. I didn’t eat well today and I didn’t get my steps in. I got frustrated and snarky with the AI platforms when I didn’t make solid progress on my model. These were not good examples of temperance or wisdom. My success yesterday was in not reaching out to Tim or Mike when I had a new idea on the Professional development. This was a good exercise in temperance because I reached out enough the previous day. It was not a terrible day, but just not a good day. Today I am going to be less snarky, which is grounded in selfishness, and more celebratory.",

I am not a procrastinator, but if it seems that I am procrastinating it’s because I don’t have a clear plan as to what I am trying to do. Yesterday, it seemed like I was procrastinating in regards to creating the lesson for my 314 class. I analyzed this and came to the conclusion that what I was lacking was a plan. Instead of diving into creating the lesson, I focused instead on planning holistically and creating an outline. Today I find myself motivated and ready to dive in. My virtual class yesterday day was stressful because I was using Penny’s chrome book but there was no way to do breakout rooms which was a key portion of the lesson. I am proud that I maintained my composure and then found a solution. This was a solid exhibition of wisdom because the lack of breakouts was out of my control. I may have over communicated with Tim and Mike yesterday. This stems from my desire to control. I am trying to make certain that our PD at Ridgewood is really effective. I need to monitor this because it is leadership but I can overdo it. Over sharing is not a Stoic trait and is not an example of acting with temperance.",

I set a hard goal of saving my model and finding the path on my computer where it is saved. I accomplished this by 11:30 am. I really wanted to jump into a new challenge, but I exercised temperance and respected my goal. I decided to not work on my model and instead of just lounging in the afternoon, which would get old, I helped Penny paint the tv room which she really appreciated. This was a good practice of justice. In the early evening I had my virtual meeting with Ridgewood. The Teams connection was bad and made the meeting frustrating. Wisdom dictates that this was a factor that was outside of my control, but it caused me to be hyper which makes me less effective. I also over shared with Tim, which was not a good exercise of temperance. After the meeting, I kept scheming for ways to make the PD session better, which disrupted my sleep.

I consciously chose to not offer personal information and instead ask them about themselves. This goes against my default which is to share personal information freely. It turned out to be wise because they began to prompt for information about myself. I did the same thing with my wife. I completed household chores like changing the sheets and cleaning the pans after dinner without being prompted and without seeking recognition. This led to sincere acknowledgement on her part once she discovered these efforts. I also exercised temperance in terms of my to-do list.

However, you avoid direct confrontation of the issue, keeping a \"low profile\" rather than speaking up about how this makes you feel. There is room for growth in finding positive ways to increase religious understanding. You demonstrate wisdom in discerning internal versus external control, recognizing that while you cannot control your teammates' actions, you can control your own response. You also wisely prioritize team cohesion over your own anger and frustration. Continuing to develop acceptance of religious differences could be beneficial. You uphold principles of fairness in not letting the prayer circle divide the team and come between your relationships with teammates. A more courageous approach would be speaking out against injustice, promoting equality and mutual understanding. But your restraint helps maintain team harmony. You exercise temperance in controlling anger and frustration, not allowing them to spill out in negative ways. You demonstrate restraint in speech and avoid escalating conflict. However, some internal struggle with desires for inclusion and equality exists. You handle this challenging situation commendably overall. Continuing to develop self-awareness, vulnerability, courage in promoting understanding, and acceptance of differences could lead to growth. Maintaining team cohesion through restraint and fairness are strengths to build upon. I encourage speaking your truth compassionately. Let me know if you would like me to analyze another reflection or if you have any other questions!"

Celebrate your accomplishments, but find a balance that doesn't overshadow others or feel boastful. Feedback: Strengths: You're self-aware and honest with yourself about your shortcomings, which is crucial for growth. You also seem genuinely interested in personal improvement and actively reflect on your actions. Areas for improvement: Deepen your introspection: Go beyond recognizing your reactions to exploring the motivations behind them. Ask yourself \"why\" you felt frustrated with Russell or hyper in class. Understanding the root causes allows for more targeted responses. Embrace the Stoic concept of Amor Fati: Accepting what you cannot control (Russell's feelings, class interest) with grace and focusing on what you can (your own reactions) reduces unnecessary frustration. Practice active moderation: Instead of \"some calming down\" or \"some moderation,\" set concrete goals for how you want to express yourself. For example, \"I will take three deep breaths before speaking in class\" or \"I will limit Facebook promotions to one per week.\" Encouragement: Celebrate your victories! Running at 62 is incredible, and your self-awareness regarding self-promotion shows willingness to grow. Keep this momentum going! Remember, Stoicism is a journey, not a destination. Don't be discouraged by setbacks; view them as opportunities to learn and refine your practice. Look for role models who embody Stoic virtues. Reading about Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus can provide inspiration and practical guidance. Homecoming Tip: Focus on genuine connection and conversation. Ask questions, listen intently, and celebrate others' achievements. Your enthusiasm will shine through authentically, without the need for self-promotion. This reflection shows strong potential for Stoic growth. Keep reflecting, analyzing, and implementing actionable changes. You can do this!"

Recognizes areas for self-improvement, but could benefit from pausing more before speaking to consider what is truly needed in a situation. Shows empathy and desire for equitable treatment of others, though ending a conversation prematurely points to occasional lapses. Effort at humility and restraint is evident but self-control could be strengthened to avoid impulsive speech. Overall, the actions described indicate good self-awareness and alignment with Stoic principles at times. However, each situation reveals opportunities to develop greater discipline in speech and interactions. Before entering conversations, consider what is truly helpful and needed rather than merely what you desire to share. Seek to give others full presence and attention. Work on restraint in making assumptions about others' lives or imposing your own will onto situations. Progress requires maintaining mindfulness from a place of wisdom - recognize the areas calling for growth and then summon the courage to attend to them with justice and temperance. You have the capacity for exemplary Stoic virtue - let this analysis strengthen your commitment to those highest ideals. The path lies open before you."

While acknowledging this attachment is the first step, showing courage would involve actively working to detach emotionally from external events. Since there's no clear indication of taking action to overcome this attachment. On the positive side, you demonstrated courage by acknowledging the potential challenges of your sales pitch but still taking action. This aligns with the virtue of facing challenges head-on.

    "feedback": "I admire your honesty and self-awareness about your fear and lack of courage in displaying your husband's picture. Recognizing your limitations is the first step towards improvement. However, choosing expediency over self-expression is a conflict with the Stoic ideal of living authentically according to your values. While fearing parental judgment is understandable, completely suppressing your identity weakens your courage. You display wisdom in understanding the need for pragmatism in your situation. Recognizing the importance of your job and appreciating your students are wise judgments. Balancing self-expression with professional well-being requires careful consideration. Treating your students with empathy and compassion demonstrates justice in action. You are upholding the fundamental Stoic principle of treating others with fairness and understanding, regardless of their background or beliefs. You express self-doubt about your temperance, though the evidence suggests otherwise. Suppressing your feelings to maintain harmony while upholding your commitment to your students requires a degree of emotional control. However, striving to avoid conflict entirely might prevent opportunities for open dialogue and understanding. Feedback and Encouragement: Acknowledge the complexity: Your situation presents a nuanced ethical dilemma. It's valid to prioritize your students' well-being and job security while still acknowledging the internal conflict it creates. Seek a middle ground: Explore subtle ways to express your identity at work. Perhaps a meaningful symbol or statement instead of a picture could be a compromise. Engage in honest conversations: If an opportunity arises, consider having open and respectful dialogues with some parents or colleagues you trust. You might be surprised by their open-mindedness and support. Focus on long-term progress: Building courage takes time and consistent effort. Celebrate small victories, like acknowledging your internal conflict, and use them as stepping stones towards bolder steps in the future. Practice acceptance: Accept that some discomfort might be inevitable with any choice you make. Focus on aligning your actions with your overall values and living with integrity, even if it's not always easy. Remember, Stoicism is about striving for progress, not perfection. Embrace your journey of self-discovery and celebrate your strengths while working on areas for improvement. Keep reflecting, keep learning, and keep striving to live authentically, even in challenging situations. I believe you have the strength and wisdom to navigate this path, and I'm here to support you along the way."

I will now assess it against the Stoic rubric and provide feedback: You show some avoidance of difficult interpersonal situations and fear of not achieving your goals with the model. However, you demonstrate courage in persisting with the model despite setbacks. You seem to struggle with distinguishing needs from wants, as the model has distracted you from obligations. You also blame external factors like Bronwyn and Chuck's assumed political conversations. However, you show some wisdom in recognizing the need for balance and setting specific objectives. No obvious injustice is indicated. You aim to treat Penny fairly by monitoring her reactions. The reflection shows no exploitation of others for personal gain. You acknowledge excess in neglecting obligations and failing to properly connect with Penny at an important moment. However, you lacked restraint and balance between the model and relationships. In summary, this reflection indicates some struggles with courage in confronting interpersonal fears, wisdom in balancing priorities and distinguishing needs from wants, and temperance in indulging the modeling excessively. Justice is a relative strength. For growth, I suggest setting aside designated relationship time where the model is set aside, creating a schedule to ensure obligations are met, and pausing model work if specific objectives cannot be met to rest and reset with intention. Focusing on temperance and fortifying relationships may strengthen courage and wisdom. Small consistent steps toward balance will accumulate. You clearly have the self-awareness and motivation for continued development along the Stoic path. Please let me know if you would like me to assess another daily reflection or if you have any other questions!"

However, panicking and sleeplessness suggest a strong emotional reaction, indicating a need to develop calmness and resilience in the face of challenges. Recognizing your lack of \"practicing wisdom\" shows insight, but dwelling on past mistakes isn't as productive as planning future actions. Maintaining mindfulness of impermanence and focusing on what you can control (your mindset, actions) would demonstrate greater wisdom. Your focus on personal improvement (weight loss, learning) and self-care (meditation) indicates a commitment to treating yourself fairly and prioritizing your well-being. Progress on weight loss and meditation are positive, but sleeplessness and restlessness reveal an imbalance in your emotional state. Finding better tools to manage anxiety and maintain inner peace will promote greater temperance. Feedback: You're on the right track with introspection and self-care. Focus on proactive actions for managing anxiety and uncertainty, rather than dwelling on past mistakes. Challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone and embrace the unknown with less fear. Combine self-care with external action: apply your \"figuring things out\" confidence to addressing job opportunities and career changes. Deepen your practice of meditation: explore longer sessions and different techniques to find one that truly calms your mind. Remember: progress takes time. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your successes, and keep practicing! Encouragement: View challenges as opportunities for growth. Trust your ability to learn and adapt. Find your inner strength and face uncertainty with courage. Prioritize your well-being and nurture inner peace. I'm here for you, every day! Keep journaling and I'll keep analyzing.

Consider incorporating meditation into your daily routine to enhance clarity and self-awareness. Work on making a consistent to-do list to prioritize tasks and manage time effectively. Be cautious not to let potential job opportunities affect your emotions and expectations negatively. Continue practicing patience and justice in your interactions, maintaining a fair and empathetic approach. Prioritize balance and self-control to avoid neglecting important aspects of your life, such as classes. Remember, improvement is a continuous process. Keep reflecting and making intentional efforts towards growth."

    "input_text": "Where did I go wrong? I am too quick to respond. I got the email from Zane State and I immediately responded. I could have come up with a better response if I had waited. I need to balance my productivity with prudence. What did I do right? I slept better. I was friendly and engaging to people. I had a distracted meditation session, but I did it! I was presented with a problem, Aaron not coming to my class, and used AI to adapt. I hope my lesson plan idea works. What did I leave undone? A few chores like calling on the weed wacker. I need to do better at listening and acting on things that don’t interest me. What could I do better in the future? Exercise temperance in terms of needing to respond quickly.",

    "feedback": "Though you identified your impulsiveness as a flaw, the fact that you tackled the challenge of Aaron's absence with creativity and utilized AI demonstrates significant courage. This proactive approach showcases a willingness to face difficulties head-on. While acknowledging the benefit of sleeping better and the value of meditation (even when imperfect), your impulsiveness in responding to the email indicates a need for further discernment between immediate action and considered response. Recognizing the opportunity for a better response reveals nascent wisdom, but full actualization requires consistent practice. Your friendliness and engagement towards others suggest a commitment to fairness and treating everyone with respect. Balancing the needs of various stakeholders (yourself, students, colleagues) is an ongoing challenge, but your efforts seem aligned with the spirit of justice. Acknowledging the need for temperance in your reactions highlights self-awareness, a crucial step towards improvement. However, the presence of unfinished chores and the lingering struggle with impulsiveness indicate a need for stronger discipline and control over desires. Feedback and Encouragement: You've identified your key weakness - impulsiveness - but self-awareness is just the first step. Focus on strengthening your internal dialogue before acting. Pause, reflect, and choose your response consciously. Meditation, journaling, and seeking feedback from trusted friends can contribute to this development. Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. Tackle mundane chores alongside your desired activities to create a sense of balance and avoid neglecting responsibilities. Celebrate your victories! Sleeping better, engaging with others, and tackling challenges with creativity are all commendable achievements. Keep building on these successes to solidify positive habits and foster further growth. Remember: Progress in Stoic practice is a journey, not a destination. Celebrate your successes, learn from your shortcomings, and strive for continuous improvement. You're on the right path, so keep applying these virtues and witness your personal growth unfold! P.S. Don't be afraid to be tough on yourself. A bit of healthy self-criticism coupled with unwavering self-compassion is the perfect recipe for Stoic excellence. I'm here to support you on this journey, so feel free to share your daily reflections whenever you're ready. Let's keep fostering your inner Stoic hero, one day at a time!"

    "input_text": "Where did I go wrong? I didn’t sleep well because I was too wound up. Did not squeeze in 5-minute meditation. What did I do right? I have remained committed to trying new things and promoting AI at my college. I have created a demonstration of AI for the 29th. Our college president will be there along with many other important local leaders. I navigated a phone call between Brent and Bob. I am excited and my department chair is really excited.nWhat did I leave undone? I didn’t review my daily journal like I intended. Tomorrow I will do that instead of journal. What could I do better in the future? Make time to meditate and guard against looking at your phone at night.",

    "feedback": "You showed courage in continuing to promote AI at your college despite challenges. Creating a demonstration takes bravery. However, you showed some fear in not getting enough sleep and failing to meditate. You demonstrated wisdom in creating an AI demonstration for leaders and trying new things. However, you struggled with distinguishing wants (looking at your phone) versus needs (sleep and reflection). I don't see strong evidence of justice or injustice in your actions based on the entry. You could speak out more for what you think is right. You indulged the desire for stimulation over sleep and reflection time. More discipline is needed regarding phone use. In terms of feedback, you clearly have areas of strength in courage and wisdom when it comes to pursuing innovation. However, you need more balance regarding when to push forward versus when to pause and reflect. Be disciplined and just with yourself by distinguishing wants from needs consistently. Limit phone use to guard time for higher priorities like health and self-examination. In the future, schedule reflection time as you would any other appointment. Commit to meditating first thing, even just 5 minutes. Finally, recognize that everyone struggles with moderation sometimes - be accepting while striving for self-control. With consistent effort, you will embody these virtues. I encourage you to keep working at it! Let me know if you have any other questions."

    "input_text": "I am really struggling. My wife died almost a year ago and I am so lonely. I know that Stoicism teaches wisdom in terms of accepting things that are out of our control, like the death of a spouse, but I am so lonely. I just wish I had someone to talk to about these things. I am not working anymore so I don’t have much human interaction. My kids live close by and I go see them occasionally, but they were much closer to their mother. I sometimes struggle with what to talk about with not just my children, but also my grandchildren. There have been times where I showed courage and initiated social interactions, like lunch dates with old friends. But these occasions seemed forced. I know that I need to try more. I am just unmotivated and sad right now.",

    "feedback": "I'm truly sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing, and I appreciate your openness in sharing your feelings. Let's assess your current situation based on the rubric and the four cardinal virtues of stoicism. It takes courage to acknowledge your struggles, but there's room for improvement in initiating social interactions. Keep in mind that it's okay to feel sad, and taking small steps to engage with others might help. You've shown wisdom in recognizing the Stoic principle of accepting things beyond your control. Understanding the need to try more and acknowledging your emotional state demonstrates wisdom in self-awareness. While you've made efforts to engage in social interactions, there's room for improvement in finding meaningful connections. Continue to seek justice in your relationships by fostering deeper connections with your children and grandchildren. It's understandable to feel unmotivated and sad in your current situation. However, working on finding a balance between acknowledging your emotions and actively seeking positive interactions could be beneficial. The focus areas for improvement are courage (especially in initiating social interactions) and temperance (finding a balance between acknowledging emotions and seeking positive interactions). Feedback and Suggestions: Seek professional support, such as counseling or therapy, to navigate through the grieving process and find ways to cope with loneliness. Consider joining support groups or communities where individuals share similar experiences. This can provide a supportive environment for open discussions. Keep engaging with your children and grandchildren, and try to find common interests to deepen your connections. Explore activities or hobbies that align with your interests, as this could provide additional opportunities for social interactions. Be patient with yourself, understanding that healing takes time, and it's okay to seek help. Remember, reaching out for support is a sign of strength, and taking small steps towards positive interactions can contribute to your well-being."

    "input_text": "I feel like most men don’t notice me. I work hard. I have a good sense of humor. I am outgoing and friendly. I am not unattractive. And yet, I would not qualify myself as a classic beauty, nor is my body type sexy. I have lots of friends and my job is fulfilling, and yet there is something missing. I know friends that get boyfriends who are jerks and ultimately they would be happier alone. I know that Stoicism teaches us that we shouldn’t seek happiness outside of ourselves, and yet I would love to be in a relationship. There are guys that I am attracted to, but I don’t think that they see me as a potential romantic partner, they instead look at me as a friend. I know that in this day and age, it is acceptable for a woman to ask out a man, but I am afraid that this would look desperate. I guess I just need to keep being the person that i am, and if a romantic relationship develops organically I can rejoice.",

    "feedback": "You show self-awareness about your strengths and limitations when it comes to relationships. However, fear of rejection is preventing you from taking action to ask someone out. This compromises courage. You demonstrate wisdom in recognizing external beauty is not the key to fulfillment and that bad relationships should be avoided. However, you still overly prioritize romantic relationships as necessary for happiness. I don't see strong evidence for or against yourself here. You seem to treat others fairly. You are struggling with temperance when it comes to romantic desires and feeling sorry for yourself. This leads to negative emotions and impulsive thinking. In terms of feedback, remember that courage comes from within and does not require others' validation. Asking someone out may feel scary, but typically leads to more fulfillment regardless of the outcome. Happiness must come from within first - let go of external dependencies. With self-restraint and perspective, you can move forward with romantic interests from a grounded place, or contentedly without them. Keep cultivating self-love, which attracts love. I encourage you to reflect on alignments to Stoic ideals. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
