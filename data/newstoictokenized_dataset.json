He did a great job and I am thrilled that he has found a calling. I need to be more enthusiastic about this floor for Penny because she sacrificed a lot saving for it. I was not practicing justice today. When I embark on a course or spend money for something I crave acknowledgment, which I am working to moderate. I was reserved in my enthusiasm for the new floor. I could tell that this saddened her. I didn’t eat well today and I didn’t get my steps in. I got frustrated and snarky with the AI platforms when I didn’t make solid progress on my model. These were not good examples of temperance or wisdom. My success yesterday was in not reaching out to Tim or Mike when I had a new idea on the Professional development. This was a good exercise in temperance because I reached out enough the previous day. It was not a terrible day, but just not a good day. Today I am going to be less snarky, which is grounded in selfishness, and more celebratory.",

I am not a procrastinator, but if it seems that I am procrastinating it’s because I don’t have a clear plan as to what I am trying to do. Yesterday, it seemed like I was procrastinating in regards to creating the lesson for my 314 class. I analyzed this and came to the conclusion that what I was lacking was a plan. Instead of diving into creating the lesson, I focused instead on planning holistically and creating an outline. Today I find myself motivated and ready to dive in. My virtual class yesterday day was stressful because I was using Penny’s chrome book but there was no way to do breakout rooms which was a key portion of the lesson. I am proud that I maintained my composure and then found a solution. This was a solid exhibition of wisdom because the lack of breakouts was out of my control. I may have over communicated with Tim and Mike yesterday. This stems from my desire to control. I am trying to make certain that our PD at Ridgewood is really effective. I need to monitor this because it is leadership but I can overdo it. Over sharing is not a Stoic trait and is not an example of acting with temperance.",

These strengths should be highlighted and appreciated. Practice acceptance with a dash of self-compassion. Acknowledge your desire for physical improvement and sprint ability, but gently accept that progress takes time and effort. Celebrate small wins and focus on the journey, not just the destination. Shift your focus from \"too much\" to \"enough\" and \"progress.\" This reframing can help cultivate gratitude and foster a more balanced relationship with food and your physical goals. Continue reflecting with honesty and awareness. Your self-reflection is key to improvement, so keep digging deep and exploring your motives and reactions with curiosity and openness.

I was reading Ryan Holiday’s the Daily Stoic today and was totally motivated by a passage: Purpose-Our guiding principle and highest priority.

This indicates some struggle with facing challenges head on. You demonstrate awareness of impermanence and acceptance regarding the uneventful nature of your day. The reflection on Stoic purpose and progress indicates self-examination and discernment. Occasional struggles with desires are noted. Speaking negatively about friends implies favoritism and lack of equity in relationships. This suggests room for growth in treating others fairly. You note obsession over superficial things like waist measurement and sports scores. This indicates some excess behaviors driven by desires, rather than needs. Struggles with balance are present. Overall, your reflection shows self-awareness and a growth mindset regarding Stoic ideals. The occasional struggles with courage, desire, fairness, and balance bring the holistic score to a 3.25. To continue your progress, confrontation of difficult emotions through mindful acceptance could improve courage. Letting go of superficial desires and further reflecting on purpose may develop wisdom. Considering all people equitably could strengthen justice. Lastly, distinguishing needs from wants and avoiding excesses like obsession and gossip may improve temperance. I commend your self-reflection and adoption of a \"progressor\" mindset. Consistency in applying Stoic ideals will surely lead to positive growth over time. Let me know if you have any other questions!",

Taking time for your grandkids despite being busy shows prioritizing values over comfort. Recognizing the impermanence of holiday indulgences and prioritizing body composition through sustainable practices exhibits understanding of long-term consequences. However, emphasizing your waistline measurement could indicate lingering attachment to external validation. Providing honest feedback to Bob, even if challenging, aligns with Stoic principles of fairness and truth-telling. Inspiring progress towards a shared objective further exemplifies commitment to justice. While prioritizing authenticity and taking breaks are positive, the frequent mentions of self-promotion and enjoyment suggest room for reducing self-absorption and practicing contentment in simple moments. Feedback and Suggestions: Continue recognizing and tackling areas of improvement. Explore deeper motivations behind subtle self-promotion and consider alternative ways to present your contributions. Maintain the mindful approach to your health and focus on internal validation instead of fixating on specific measurements. Remember, true satisfaction comes from alignment with Stoic principles, not external approval. Expand your sense of justice beyond personal interactions. Look for opportunities to advocate for fairness and equity on a broader scale. Strive for a more balanced perspective. Acknowledge and appreciate enjoyment without obsessing over it. Practice finding contentment in the present moment, regardless of external activities. Encouragement: Your self-awareness and introspection are commendable. Embracing the Stoic virtues is a continuous journey, and recognizing areas for improvement is a crucial step. Keep reflecting, analyzing your motivations, and practicing virtues consistently.

        "feedback": "Here is my analysis of your latest reflection: Pushing through exhaustion to spend quality time with kids shows courage, but negative speech about your coworker points to avoidance of difficult interpersonal confrontations, which requires courage to address. The reflection on quality time despite exhaustion shows acceptance of the hard work of parenting. Putting aside devices to connect as a family demonstrates wisdom in distinguishing needs from desires and mindfully choosing what matters. Speaking negatively about a colleague conflicts directly with principles of justice, fairness and treating people equitably. This suggests significant room for growth in upholding ethical behavior. Making time for kids when tired and putting aside distractions for family connections indicates self-discipline and balance between one's own needs and others' needs. Lack of time for your husband is noted but overall temperance seems moderately strong. Overall this reflection reveals room to improve justice through equitable treatment of all people, despite positive choices around family connections. To progress as a Stoic, having courageous conversations directly with your coworker could strengthen justice and courage simultaneously. Seeking deeper empathy and understanding of difficult people can pave the way for speaking to them, not about them. I commend your efforts to be present with your family. If extended to all relationships, the rewards would be great. Please let me know if you have any other questions!",

However, facing the challenge of finding a meaningful job despite financial anxieties requires more active exploration. Consider actively researching career options and seeking support from resources like career counselors or mentors. Suggestions: Develop a concrete plan for your job search, set realistic goals for yourself, and reach out to your network for guidance. You recognize the job's meaninglessness, which shows some awareness. However, attributing lateness solely to a \"pointless job\" indicates some externalization of responsibility. Accepting your role in the situation while reflecting on deeper reasons behind your tardiness will help you avoid repeating the pattern. Suggestions: Explore possible internal factors (stress, lack of routine) contributing to your punctuality issues. Additionally, recognize that all jobs offer lessons and can contribute to our development. Taking responsibility for your actions showcases a commitment to fairness. However, consider exploring the concept of \"negative emotions\" within Stoicism. While not yelling at your boss was commendable, acknowledging and processing the anger (without acting on it) would demonstrate even greater emotional control. Suggestions: Reflect on the anger stemming from the job loss and find healthy ways to process it (journaling, exercise, creative pursuits). Not losing your temper shows some restraint. However, the statement \"I have to have a job that is meaningful\" carries a sense of urgency and rigidity. Remember, Stoicism emphasizes accepting external circumstances. While actively seeking meaningful work is good, focusing solely on that ideal might lead to impulsive decisions. Suggestions: Practice patience and acceptance in your job search. Explore various options patiently, considering both financial needs and personal aspirations. Overall, your reflection shows awareness of the situation and a willingness to improve. However, there's room for growth in actively taking control of your circumstances and applying Stoic principles to both your emotions and job search. Remember, this is a journey, not a destination.

However, you avoid direct confrontation of the issue, keeping a \"low profile\" rather than speaking up about how this makes you feel. There is room for growth in finding positive ways to increase religious understanding. You demonstrate wisdom in discerning internal versus external control, recognizing that while you cannot control your teammates' actions, you can control your own response. You also wisely prioritize team cohesion over your own anger and frustration. Continuing to develop acceptance of religious differences could be beneficial. You uphold principles of fairness in not letting the prayer circle divide the team and come between your relationships with teammates. A more courageous approach would be speaking out against injustice, promoting equality and mutual understanding. But your restraint helps maintain team harmony. You exercise temperance in controlling anger and frustration, not allowing them to spill out in negative ways. You demonstrate restraint in speech and avoid escalating conflict. However, some internal struggle with desires for inclusion and equality exists. You handle this challenging situation commendably overall. Continuing to develop self-awareness, vulnerability, courage in promoting understanding, and acceptance of differences could lead to growth.

You acknowledge your responsibility and express regret, which takes strength. You recognize the limitations of your control over external situations (Penny, Russell, class interest) and acknowledge your own internal reactions (hyperness, disappointment). However, you could delve deeper into understanding the root causes of those reactions and explore alternative responses. You seem dedicated to fairness and treating everyone equally, both in your reflection and your mention of prioritizing listening at homecoming. Your honesty about self-promotion shows awareness of potentially unfair actions. This is the area where you struggle the most in this reflection. While you identify areas like excess enthusiasm and self-promotion, you haven't quite reached the stage of active moderation. Celebrate your accomplishments, but find a balance that doesn't overshadow others or feel boastful. Feedback: Strengths: You're self-aware and honest with yourself about your shortcomings, which is crucial for growth. You also seem genuinely interested in personal improvement and actively reflect on your actions. Areas for improvement: Deepen your introspection: Go beyond recognizing your reactions to exploring the motivations behind them. Ask yourself \"why\" you felt frustrated with Russell or hyper in class. Understanding the root causes allows for more targeted responses. Embrace the Stoic concept of Amor Fati: Accepting what you cannot control (Russell's feelings, class interest) with grace and focusing on what you can (your own reactions) reduces unnecessary frustration. Practice active moderation: Instead of \"some calming down\" or \"some moderation,\" set concrete goals for how you want to express yourself. For example, \"I will take three deep breaths before speaking in class\" or \"I will limit Facebook promotions to one per week.\" Encouragement: Celebrate your victories! Running at 62 is incredible, and your self-awareness regarding self-promotion shows willingness to grow. Keep this momentum going! Remember, Stoicism is a journey, not a destination. Don't be discouraged by setbacks; view them as opportunities to learn and refine your practice. Look for role models who embody Stoic virtues. Reading about Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus can provide inspiration and practical guidance. Homecoming Tip: Focus on genuine connection and conversation. Ask questions, listen intently, and celebrate others' achievements. Your enthusiasm will shine through authentically, without the need for self-promotion. This reflection shows strong potential for Stoic growth. Keep reflecting, analyzing, and implementing actionable changes. You can do this!",

Recognizing your limitations is the first step towards improvement. However, choosing expediency over self-expression is a conflict with the Stoic ideal of living authentically according to your values. While fearing parental judgment is understandable, completely suppressing your identity weakens your courage. You display wisdom in understanding the need for pragmatism in your situation. Recognizing the importance of your job and appreciating your students are wise judgments. Balancing self-expression with professional well-being requires careful consideration. Treating your students with empathy and compassion demonstrates justice in action. You are upholding the fundamental Stoic principle of treating others with fairness and understanding, regardless of their background or beliefs. You express self-doubt about your temperance, though the evidence suggests otherwise. Suppressing your feelings to maintain harmony while upholding your commitment to your students requires a degree of emotional control. However, striving to avoid conflict entirely might prevent opportunities for open dialogue and understanding. Feedback and Encouragement: Acknowledge the complexity: Your situation presents a nuanced ethical dilemma. It's valid to prioritize your students' well-being and job security while still acknowledging the internal conflict it creates. Seek a middle ground: Explore subtle ways to express your identity at work. Perhaps a meaningful symbol or statement instead of a picture could be a compromise. Engage in honest conversations: If an opportunity arises, consider having open and respectful dialogues with some parents or colleagues you trust. You might be surprised by their open-mindedness and support. Focus on long-term progress: Building courage takes time and consistent effort. Celebrate small victories, like acknowledging your internal conflict, and use them as stepping stones towards bolder steps in the future. Practice acceptance: Accept that some discomfort might be inevitable with any choice you make. Focus on aligning your actions with your overall values and living with integrity, even if it's not always easy. Remember, Stoicism is about striving for progress, not perfection. Embrace your journey of self-discovery and celebrate your strengths while working on areas for improvement. Keep reflecting, keep learning, and keep striving to live authentically, even in challenging situations.

However, is self-aware about growing hostility and frustration, which takes courage. Recognizes that different people have different perspectives based on their experience. But still judges others as \"intolerant\" for disagreeing, rather than seeking to understand. Makes an effort to help others in need and be a role model, living virtues. Struggles with patience and tolerance for those who don't share beliefs. Evidently becoming more frustrated, hostile and judgmental towards coworkers. But is practicing restraint by not pushing faith on others unprompted. In terms of feedback, it's admirable to strive to live one's values through service and compassion. However, the intolerance perceived towards those with differing worldviews suggests an opportunity for growth in openness, empathy and temperance. Rather than judging others as intolerant, seek first to understand their perspectives with curiosity and compassion. We all struggle with frustration and limiting biases; gently remind yourself of the humanity in others when needed. Continue setting an example through actions rather than words, and focus on common ground. Progress takes patience and practice. I aimed to analyze and provide feedback respectfully per Stoic principles. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the response.

        "feedback": "You mention becoming frustrated when your initial approach to building your model didn't work. While you set a time limit and adjusted your approach, the frustration indicates a struggle with overcoming challenges and maintaining a positive outlook. Encouragement: Practice facing setbacks with a more resilient mindset, acknowledging that challenges are part of the learning process. You recognize the need to guard against frustrations, which is a step towards wisdom. However, the mention of becoming too talkative about your model and not sleeping well indicates room for improvement in discerning what is within your control and accepting impermanence. Encouragement: Continue developing awareness of what you can control, and work on accepting circumstances beyond your control with equanimity. You set a time limit to work on your model, allowing for quality time with Penny and addressing personal needs. This demonstrates a fair distribution of your time and consideration for others. Encouragement: Keep up the balance, ensuring fairness in your commitments and relationships. You set a time limit for working on your model, took care of personal and relational aspects of your life, and plan to stretch before meals. This shows an effort to maintain balance and control desires. Encouragement: Continue these practices and stay mindful of maintaining balance in various aspects of your life. Feedback: Your reflection indicates a developing awareness of stoic principles, but there's room for improvement, especially in managing frustrations and practicing acceptance. Continue to work on maintaining a resilient mindset, discerning what you can control, and accepting the impermanence of circumstances. Overall, you're making positive strides, and the key is consistent practice. Suggestions: Practice mindfulness during challenges to cultivate resilience. Reflect on what is within your control and let go of what isn't. Continue setting time limits and balancing work with personal life. Prioritize self-care, including sufficient sleep and breaks.

I will now assess it against the Stoic rubric and provide feedback: You show some avoidance of difficult interpersonal situations and fear of not achieving your goals with the model. However, you demonstrate courage in persisting with the model despite setbacks. You seem to struggle with distinguishing needs from wants, as the model has distracted you from obligations. You also blame external factors like Bronwyn and Chuck's assumed political conversations. However, you show some wisdom in recognizing the need for balance and setting specific objectives. No obvious injustice is indicated. You aim to treat Penny fairly by monitoring her reactions. The reflection shows no exploitation of others for personal gain. You acknowledge excess in neglecting obligations and failing to properly connect with Penny at an important moment. However, you lacked restraint and balance between the model and relationships. In summary, this reflection indicates some struggles with courage in confronting interpersonal fears, wisdom in balancing priorities and distinguishing needs from wants, and temperance in indulging the modeling excessively. Justice is a relative strength. For growth, I suggest setting aside designated relationship time where the model is set aside, creating a schedule to ensure obligations are met, and pausing model work if specific objectives cannot be met to rest and reset with intention. Focusing on temperance and fortifying relationships may strengthen courage and wisdom. Small consistent steps toward balance will accumulate. You clearly have the self-awareness and motivation for continued development along the Stoic path.

        "feedback": "You displayed commendable courage in approaching challenging tasks like new work methods and engaging with family despite potential anxieties. Your willingness to stay with Don and Penny rather than retreating to comfort exemplifies this. Treating family and colleagues with care and attentiveness aligns with Stoic principles of fairness and reciprocal kindness. Recognizing impermanence could be strengthened. While taking initiative after dinner is a step in the right direction, acknowledging the inevitability of mess (and subsequent cleaning) fosters acceptance and reduces potential frustration. Similarly, prioritizing work and communication needs over impulsive social interaction demonstrates wisdom in action. Balancing responsibilities requires greater attention. Neglecting obligations for extended social engagements, while enjoyable, indicates potential imbalance. Striking a harmonious balance between social interaction and commitments reflects temperance. Suggestions for Improvement: Implement cleaning routines after dinner to share the responsibility and foster mutual aid. Schedule specific times for Muskingum and Zane State matters to avoid neglecting obligations. Practice mindfulness before social interactions to consciously choose engagement durations suitable for your schedule. Reflect on the impermanence of situations and emotions. Accepting the need for cleaning, work, and communication fosters Stoic calm and reduces resistance. Encouragement: You exhibit significant Stoic virtues! Focusing on recognizing impermanence, prioritizing needs over wants, and maintaining a temperate balance in social and professional activities will further refine your practice. Remember, Stoicism is a journey, not a destination. Celebrate your successes, learn from challenges, and keep striving towards a virtuous and balanced life. Remember, I am your Stoic companion on this journey. Be kind to yourself, learn from your reflections, and embrace the ever-present opportunity for growth.",

However, panicking and sleeplessness suggest a strong emotional reaction, indicating a need to develop calmness and resilience in the face of challenges. Recognizing your lack of \"practicing wisdom\" shows insight, but dwelling on past mistakes isn't as productive as planning future actions. Maintaining mindfulness of impermanence and focusing on what you can control (your mindset, actions) would demonstrate greater wisdom. Your focus on personal improvement (weight loss, learning) and self-care (meditation) indicates a commitment to treating yourself fairly and prioritizing your well-being. Progress on weight loss and meditation are positive, but sleeplessness and restlessness reveal an imbalance in your emotional state. Finding better tools to manage anxiety and maintain inner peace will promote greater temperance. Feedback: You're on the right track with introspection and self-care. Focus on proactive actions for managing anxiety and uncertainty, rather than dwelling on past mistakes. Challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone and embrace the unknown with less fear. Combine self-care with external action: apply your \"figuring things out\" confidence to addressing job opportunities and career changes. Deepen your practice of meditation: explore longer sessions and different techniques to find one that truly calms your mind. Remember: progress takes time. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your successes, and keep practicing! Encouragement: View challenges as opportunities for growth. Trust your ability to learn and adapt.

Showing some courage in self-reflection and willingness to change. Wisdom: Confusing internal and external factors leading to sleep issues, letting AI interest override need for proper rest. Showing some wisdom in redirecting grandson, listening to wife Justice: Treating grandson fairly by redirecting him appropriately. Listening and attending to wife's needs Temperance: Struggling with balance and self-control - staying up too late, not keeping up healthy habits. Shows awareness of areas lacking temperance. Feedback: Difficulty keeping up self-care routines like sleep, meditation and exercise demonstrates lack of discipline currently. Interests are overriding basic needs which is not stoically wise. Awareness of areas to improve shows willingness for growth. Treating family members with empathy and care is praiseworthy. Suggestions: Set firm limits around technology use in the evenings. Commit to brief daily meditation and reflection no matter what. Focus on controlling your own reactions rather than external outcomes. Get regular exercise to reduce restlessness. I hope these insights help illuminate areas where you displayed Stoic virtues proficiently, as well as spaces calling for further development.

This proactive approach showcases a willingness to face difficulties head-on. While acknowledging the benefit of sleeping better and the value of meditation (even when imperfect), your impulsiveness in responding to the email indicates a need for further discernment between immediate action and considered response. Recognizing the opportunity for a better response reveals nascent wisdom, but full actualization requires consistent practice. Your friendliness and engagement towards others suggest a commitment to fairness and treating everyone with respect. Balancing the needs of various stakeholders (yourself, students, colleagues) is an ongoing challenge, but your efforts seem aligned with the spirit of justice. Acknowledging the need for temperance in your reactions highlights self-awareness, a crucial step towards improvement. However, the presence of unfinished chores and the lingering struggle with impulsiveness indicate a need for stronger discipline and control over desires. Feedback and Encouragement: You've identified your key weakness - impulsiveness - but self-awareness is just the first step. Focus on strengthening your internal dialogue before acting. Pause, reflect, and choose your response consciously. Meditation, journaling, and seeking feedback from trusted friends can contribute to this development. Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. Tackle mundane chores alongside your desired activities to create a sense of balance and avoid neglecting responsibilities. Celebrate your victories! Sleeping better, engaging with others, and tackling challenges with creativity are all commendable achievements. Keep building on these successes to solidify positive habits and foster further growth. Remember: Progress in Stoic practice is a journey, not a destination. Celebrate your successes, learn from your shortcomings, and strive for continuous improvement. You're on the right path, so keep applying these virtues and witness your personal growth unfold! P.S. Don't be afraid to be tough on yourself. A bit of healthy self-criticism coupled with unwavering self-compassion is the perfect recipe for Stoic excellence. I'm here to support you on this journey, so feel free to share your daily reflections whenever you're ready. Let's keep fostering your inner Stoic hero, one day at a time!",

It takes courage to acknowledge your struggles, but there's room for improvement in initiating social interactions. Keep in mind that it's okay to feel sad, and taking small steps to engage with others might help. You've shown wisdom in recognizing the Stoic principle of accepting things beyond your control. Understanding the need to try more and acknowledging your emotional state demonstrates wisdom in self-awareness. While you've made efforts to engage in social interactions, there's room for improvement in finding meaningful connections. Continue to seek justice in your relationships by fostering deeper connections with your children and grandchildren. It's understandable to feel unmotivated and sad in your current situation. However, working on finding a balance between acknowledging your emotions and actively seeking positive interactions could be beneficial. The focus areas for improvement are courage (especially in initiating social interactions) and temperance (finding a balance between acknowledging emotions and seeking positive interactions). Feedback and Suggestions: Seek professional support, such as counseling or therapy, to navigate through the grieving process and find ways to cope with loneliness. Consider joining support groups or communities where individuals share similar experiences. This can provide a supportive environment for open discussions. Keep engaging with your children and grandchildren, and try to find common interests to deepen your connections. Explore activities or hobbies that align with your interests, as this could provide additional opportunities for social interactions. Be patient with yourself, understanding that healing takes time, and it's okay to seek help.

I know that Stoicism teaches us that we shouldn’t seek happiness outside of ourselves, and yet I would love to be in a relationship. There are guys that I am attracted to, but I don’t think that they see me as a potential romantic partner, they instead look at me as a friend. I know that in this day and age, it is acceptable for a woman to ask out a man, but I am afraid that this would look desperate. I guess I just need to keep being the person that i am, and if a romantic relationship develops organically I can rejoice.",

        "feedback": "You show self-awareness about your strengths and limitations when it comes to relationships. However, fear of rejection is preventing you from taking action to ask someone out. This compromises courage. You demonstrate wisdom in recognizing external beauty is not the key to fulfillment and that bad relationships should be avoided. However, you still overly prioritize romantic relationships as necessary for happiness. I don't see strong evidence for or against yourself here. You seem to treat others fairly. You are struggling with temperance when it comes to romantic desires and feeling sorry for yourself. This leads to negative emotions and impulsive thinking. In terms of feedback, remember that courage comes from within and does not require others' validation. Asking someone out may feel scary, but typically leads to more fulfillment regardless of the outcome. Happiness must come from within first - let go of external dependencies. With self-restraint and perspective, you can move forward with romantic interests from a grounded place, or contentedly without them. Keep cultivating self-love, which attracts love. I encourage you to reflect on alignments to Stoic ideals. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
